part2_q1 = r"""
**Your answer:**


From our experiments we can see that increasing k usually increase the generalization of our model up to some point. 
If we look at to extremum we can see that if we take k as one we have a greater risk for error with only one neighbor. 
On the other side if we take k to be large the we will get that the decision will be made from the majority of some 
class and not the nearest neighbors.
